Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

              <h3>Research the person.</h3>
              <p>You should know as much as possible about the person you're interviewing so you go into the interview feeling prepared and in control. Look up as much relevant information about the person as you can, and try to find some recordings of in person interviews with that person if possible. This will help you have a sense of the person's personality and interview style, and to adjust your interview accordingly.

            <div class="content">
              <h3>Prepare questions</h3>
              <p>You should prepare questions that are flexible, open-ended, and which all come equipped with at least two or three follow-up questions that you can ask depending on the answer to the original question. Here are a few general rules for preparing questions for an interview: Don't ask any "yes" or "no" questions or questions that can be answered in just a few words. Ask questions that allow the person you're interviewing to expand. Ask just one question at a time. Asking more than one at a time will overwhelm your interviewee. Ask questions that are relevant to your objectives. This is an important point. You can make them creative as long as they meet your needs. Don't ask questions that are so broad that your subject doesn't know how to answer them. Your subject should be directed enough to know what type of an answer you're looking for.

              <h3>Prepare some topics for small talk.</h3>
              <p>That's right. You should even prepare the small talk you'll be making at the beginning of the interview. Even if you've only decided to talk about the weather or traffic, you should have this prepared in advance so you start the interview off on the right foot and make your subject feel instantly comfortable. If you know something about the hobbies or side-interests of the person you're interviewing, you can casually bring them up. The subject will feel more at ease if he can talk about something that makes him comfortable, especially if it has nothing to do with the interview.

              <h3>Ask your questions.</h3>
              <p>Maintain eye contact as you ask the question and listen intently to the answer. Don't say, "My first question is..." or "My next question is..." Make the person feel like you're just having a natural conversation, not firing questions at him like a detective. Always start out with questions that understand who the person is, understanding what they want, understand what the challenges are they're facing, and what the path is they want to take so that you can help them achieve those goals.

              <p>Don't say, "Well, I've run out of questions for you" or "I guess that's it..." This will make things feel awkward and like you couldn't hold up a stimulating conversation. Instead, say, "We've covered quite a bit in this conversation. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you'd like to chat about?" This makes the person feel like you were in the conversation together, instead of just in a question-and-answer situation.</p>
